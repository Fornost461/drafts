grid
initially:
    grid divided in two groups of cells: yours and your opponent’s
    no bomb is on the grid
    you have a reserve of bombs apart from the grid
your turn:
    you can remove any of your bombs from the grid and put them back into your reserve
    you can place any bomb of your reserve onto any of your cells
    your opponent does not know which of your cells are trapped
    when you’re done, click a cell of your opponent
    if it contains a bomb:
        one of your cells becomes the opponent’s (chosen randomly or by the opponent, who still ignores if it is trapped when choosing)
        if it was trapped, the bomb is removed from the cell and put into the opponent’s reserve
    otherwise:
        the cell is yours
    if you no longer have cells:
        you lost!
    otherwise:
        it is the opponent’s turn
