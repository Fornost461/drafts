grid
initially:
    the entire grid is unoccupied
you have a limited amount of checkers
2 types of checkers:
    bombs
    sheeps
your turn:
    you are allowed to rearrange bombs and sheeps, so long as exactly the same cells remain occupied
    then you can make one vacant cell yours by placing a checker on it
    your opponent does not know the type of your checkers
    when you’re done, click a cell of your opponent if he has any
    if it contains a bomb:
        one of your checkers on the grid becomes the opponent’s (chosen randomly or by the opponent, who still ignores its type when choosing)
    otherwise:
        the cell is yours
    now it’s the opponent’s turn
